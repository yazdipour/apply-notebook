# Defer
```
Dear Ms. Cevik
Firstly, I wanted to thank you so much for notifying me about the admission.
There is only one issue concerning my application which is related to the visa. Here it takes at least 100 days to book an interview appointment at the embassy. It will also take a considerable amount of time to get my visa. Therefore, I am not sure whether I will be able to be in Augsburg for this winter semester (beginning in October 2017). I was wondering if you could let me know whether there is a way I can defer my admission and start my study in the summer semester (April 2018).
Kind Regards

Dear Professor XXX
Hi, 

I am writing to inform you about the acceptance letter I received recently for PhD starting in Fall 2017 (Application Reference Number: XXX). 

I also ranked first in the national university entrance exam and have a lot of options for PhD in Iran. But undoubtedly, I prefer to continue my studying under your esteemed supervision and believe in XXX University as a golden opportunity for my future. 

I have the honor of mentioning my interest in joining your team in the application and was curious about the availability of financial support, more specifically, TA or RA positions in your research lab.

I understand if you are too busy to answer in depth. However, if you have any helpful advice it would be greatly appreciated.

Bests,
