Dear Ms. Cevik
Firstly, I wanted to thank you so much for notifying me about the admission.
There is only one issue concerning my application which is related to the visa. Here it takes at least 100 days to book an interview appointment at the embassy. It will also take a considerable amount of time to get my visa. Therefore, I am not sure whether I will be able to be in Augsburg for this winter semester (beginning in October 2017). I was wondering if you could let me know whether there is a way I can defer my admission and start my study in the summer semester (April 2018).
Kind Regards
