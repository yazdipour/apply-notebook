# Application Fee Waiver

نمونه #ایمیل برای درخواست #ویو کردن اپلیکیشن فی بر مبنای #تمپلیت دانشگاه کلتک

Dear yyyyyy,

I am writing to let you know that I am very interested in PhD program in PPPPPP at XXXX University. I am going to submit my application shortly.

I have one problem though. Unfortunately, I am unable to pay the required application fee. You probably know about the financial hardship situation in Iran: my fellowship at the institute is $ZZZ per month and my parents earn total of $YYY per month, which is hardly enough to xxxxxx.

I would like to ask you about the possibility to waive the fee or defer the payment until my arrival in US.

Thank you very much for your help and understanding.
Sincerely,
```
