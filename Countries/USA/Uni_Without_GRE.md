* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - You read right-MIT- we repeat- MIT, based out of Cambridge, is offering its graduate programme in Electrical * Engineering and Computer Science without any expectations of a GRE score. Can hardly believe it? Well- believe it!

* John Hopkins University- This well renowned Uni’s Whiting School of Engineering offers masters programmes in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer * Engineering, & Cyber Security minus the GRE. (Yeay!)

* Florida Institute of Technology – Based out of Melbourne, the Florida Institute of Technology offers the M.S Computer Information Systems Programme without * listing GRE as a requirement. 

* University of Iowa: A Master of Computer Science is offered GRE-free by the University of Iowa as a non-research, course based programme. Technically, they * encourage students to go in with a GRE-score but ahem-this isn’t mandatory for admission into the programme.

* Grand Valley State University – Based in Michigan, USA, Grand Valley State University doesn’t need its Computer Information Systems applicants to have taken the * GRE as long as their UG GPA hasn’t dipped below 3.0.

* New Mexico State University – You can also drop in an application to the New Mexico State University’s M.S. Computer Science without having to sit for the GRE.

* Purdue University – West Lafayette- This Uni also doesn’t need the GRE for its M.S. in Computer Science. 

* University of Bridgeport- Located in Connecticut, the University of Bridgeport also greets us with good GRE-news on their website: GRE is recommended, but NOT * required for admission into any of our Master’s level programmes. 

* University of Illinois – The University of Illinois offers an M.S. in Computer Science programme and states in its entry requirements  -“We do not require a GRE * score.”  (Score!)

* Towson University – Towson University’s M.S. in Computer Science also doesn’t ask for the GRE  either when you glance through their admissions section!
