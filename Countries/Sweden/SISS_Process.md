 
2. Apply for a SISS scholarship
• Apply for an SI scholarship after you have completed your application to master’s programme(s). See more information about required documents and templates below.
• During the application period 2-9 February 2018, submit the required documents digitally through our online application portal.
3. Notifications from University Admissions
• By 6 April 2018, you will receive your notification of selection results from University Admissions. SI will receive the admission results directly from University Admissions.
• Only applicants who are admitted, including conditionally admitted, to one of the eligible master’s programmes by 6 April 2018, will be considered for an SI scholarship.
• If you are only listed as a reserve/placed on waiting list and are not admitted to any of the eligible master’s programmes, you will not be considered for an SI scholarship.
• You can only be awarded a scholarship for the master’s programme you are admitted to by 6 April. Master’s programme to which you are listed as reserve, will not be considered. If you are admitted to an eligible programme by 6 April, and meanwhile are put on a waiting list for a programme you ranked higher, only the programme you got admitted to by 6 April will be considered by the selection committee. Therefore it is important that you make sure to reject reserve places in time so that your admission will not be changed. Please contact University Admissions for questions regarding how to reject reserve places and how your admission can be changed.
4. Announcement of 180 successful SI scholarship recipients
• About 180 successful SI scholarship recipients of SISS 2018/2019 are announced at si.se on 26 April 2018.
• Each successful scholarship recipient receives an official scholarship offer by email during 26-27 April 2018.
• If you receive a scholarship offer, you are required to accept or reject this offer by the deadline indicated in the offer. It is your responsibility to make sure that the email address you filled in your application is correct to be able to be notified about the offer.
• Due to the large number of applicants, only those who are offered a scholarship will be notified.
Waiting list
• A number of applicants can be placed on a waiting list for a reserve place. Scholarship offers which are rejected by successful candidates may then be offered to applicants on the waiting list. Kindly note that being placed on the waiting list does not guarantee that you will be offered a scholarship.
• SI will publish the waiting list when announcing the successful scholarship recipients. If your name is not on the list you have not been offered a reserve place.
